/**
 * The Lucene Search Indexer.
 * 
 * This class manages writing to the Lucene search index all updates. For each
 * thread modifying data in the model a separate transaction of those changes
 * will be maintained. So when a model is updated, it is expected that the model
 * object will tell the indexer that it's contents have been modified. The
 * indexer will receive that notification and keep the related submission's id
 * in a set. Then after the database transaction has been committed the index
 * transaction can be committed. Updating the index is handled by background
 * threads, in a matter completely seemless to the outside observer.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Fields:
 * 
 * subId: The id of the submission, this is available for both submissions and
 * action logs.
 * 
 * logId: The id of the action log, this is only available for action logs.
 * 
 * type: Either "submission" or "actionlog" depending on what type of record.
 * 
 * SEARCH INDEXES (SOME USED FOR SORTING)
 * 
 * searchText: search index for textual searches
 * 
 * state: The bean name of the current state. single token not analyzed (search
 * and sort)
 * 
 * searchAssigned: search index for those who are assigned. The field is
 * composed of either the id of the assigned person, or 0 for unassigned
 * submissions.
 * 
 * sortAssigned: The full name of the person assigned
 * 
 * graduationSemester: The grad year & month converted into a date object and
 * stored as milliseconds.
 * 
 * defenseDate: The date of the student's defense.
 * 
 * program: the program, a single token not analyzed (search and sort)
 * 
 * department: The department, single token not analyzed (search and sort)
 * 
 * college: The college, single token not analyzed (search and sort)
 * 
 * major: The major, single token not analyzed (search and sort)
 * 
 * embargo: The embargo name, single token not analyzed (search and sort)
 * 
 * degree: The degree, single token not analyzed (search and sort)
 * 
 * documentType: The document type's name, single token not analyzed (search and
 * sort)
 * 
 * umiRelease: Either "yes", "no", or "" for the three possible states (search
 * and sort)
 * 
 * submissionDate: The submission date for the submission as a numeric date
 * stored as milliseconds.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ONLY USED FOR SORTING:
 * 
 * studentName: The student name for sorting.
 * 
 * studentEmail: The student's email for sorting.
 * 
 * institutionalIdentifier: The student's institutional identifier
