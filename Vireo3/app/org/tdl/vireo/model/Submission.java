/**
 * The submission object is really the heart of the vireo workflow data model.
 * It represents the student's ETD application.Â  The only absolutely required
 * parameters are the system assigned identifier, and the original person
 * submitting. Instead of treating committee members as first class person
 * objects like we do for students we specialize their treatment as a separate
 * object type. The reason for this is because the institution may not be able
 * to authenticate the committee member through shibboleth because there are
 * cases where the committee member is outside of the university, perhaps
 * because this is a joint degree program or they have retired. To handle this
 * case, when vireo sends an email to the faculty member for approval an email
 * hash is generated the chair is expected to use the hash to authenticate their
 * return to vireo where they can approve the application.
