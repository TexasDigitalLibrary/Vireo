/**
 * Common Field Configuration Names
 * 
 * Stored in the SettingsRepository there are global configuration objects
 * consisting of name / value pairs. Various attributes about each field
 * are stored there such as the student display label, help text, and
 * whether the field is enabled or not. Each field is defined as an enum,
 * with those three properties underneath. So to find the values for the
 * FIRST_NAME field you would say:
 * 
 * FIRST_NAME.LABEL
 * FIRST_NAME.HELP
 * FIRST_NAME.ENABLED
 * 
 * Future developers, feel free to add additional configuration parameters to
 * this class as needed.
