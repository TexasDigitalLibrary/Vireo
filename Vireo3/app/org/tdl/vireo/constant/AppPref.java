/**
 * Common Application Preferences Names.
 * 
 * Stored with each person are preference objects consisting of name / value
 * pairs. These preferences can determine how particular parts of the
 * application respond during specific circumstances. The static values defined
 * here are the common definitions for those preferences parameters. This allows
 * these names to be defined in one location while being statically linked
 * throughout the application.
 * 
 * Future developers, feel free to add additional parameters to this class as
 * needed.
