# Assetstore
# ~~~~~~
# Vireo stores several types of files these are the locations for where they

# Authentication
# ~~~~~
# You have several authentication options for security identifying Vireo users.
# Below configures how each of these options work, you can either enable only
# one option or have multiple the options enabled allowing the user to select
# which one is best for their particular case.

# Force all authenticated sessions to use SSL

# Limit advisor's affiliation

# This option requires that your authentication source (probably LDAP or 
# Shibboleth) receive an attribute similar to eduPersonAffilation which
# describes how the person is affiliated with the institution. When this
# parameter is supplied then you can limit advisors to only those who have a 
# particular affiliation(s). Supply all the acceptable affiliations below 
# separated by a semicolon. if the list is empty or commented out then, all 
# affiliations will be allowed to act as an advisor in Vireo and approve 
# applications.
#

# Locking submission fields
#
# Determine what fields should be locked during the submission process. If the
# authentication method is able to provide information about a person and that
# grouping of information listed below as locked then the student will not be
# able to edit that information during submission. If the authentication
# mechanism is not able to provide the information, or it is invalid, then 
# the student will always be able to edit the field no matter what the lock
# setting says. Available groups:
#
# "personal": first, middle, and last names along with birth year.
# "affiliation": department, degree, major.
# "contact": permanent and current phone, address, and email.
#
submit.field.lock = personal

# Secret key
# ~~~~~
# The secrete key used to secure cryptographic functions (like authentication
# cookies). Use the "play secret" command to generate a new random key for each
# deployment. If you're application is load balanced between several instances
# they must all have the same key.
